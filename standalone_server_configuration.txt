In general, two types of configuration mode:

1. Standalone:
    - default configuration
    - configuration file can be found in the EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/ directory
    - Uses the EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh to start the instance
    - Greate for single instance or small cluster

2. Managed Domain:
    - Single point configuration control
    - Configuration files can be found in the EAP_HOME/domain/configuration directory
    - Uses the EAP_HOME/bin/domain.sh to start the instance
    - Great for multi-instance cluster

To configure Standalone mode:
1. Cd into the standalone.xml location and make changes:
    $ cd /opt/jboss-eap/standalone/configuration/
    $ sudo vim standalone.xml
    And make changes to 0.0.0.0 from 127.0.0.1 in public interface binding address as in management too.
    $ sudo /opt/jboss-eap/bin/init.d/jboss-eap-rhel.sh restart
2. Also, cd into the /etc/default/ and edit jboss-eap.conf
    $ sudo vim /etc/default/jboss-eap.conf
    And unhash out JBOSS_MODE and JBOSS_CONFIG.
    And finally, restart the service:
    $ sudo /opt/jboss-eap/bin/init.d/jboss-eap-rhel.sh restart
