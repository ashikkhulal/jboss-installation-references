JBOSS EAP 5 Deployment methods:

- Deploying using the management cli:
    - single command-line interface with the ability to create and run deployment scripts.
    Deploy:
    $ deployment deploy-file /path/to/test-app.war
    Check that the application has deployed using the deployment info command:
    $ deployment info
    Undeploy or disable deployment:
    $ deployment undeploy test-app.war
    $ deployment disable test-app.war
    
- Deploying using the management console:
    - the benefits of a graphical interface that is easy to use.
- Deploying using the deployment scanner:
    - monitors the deployment directory for applications to deploy and scans every 5 seconds for changes.
    Deploy:
    $ sudo cp /path/to/test-app.war EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments/
    Undeploy:
    $ rm EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments/test-app.war.deployed
    Redeploy:
    $ touch EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments/test-app.war.dodeploy
- Deploying using Maven:
    - Uses wildfly maven plugin for simple operations to deploy and undeploy applications.
    Install Maven using sudo yum install maven
    Deploy:
    $ mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
    Undeploy:
    $ mvn wildfly:undeploy
- Deploying using the HTTP api:
    - allows for a curl command to deploy an application.

To zip back, run:
    $ jar -cvf <appname>.war

To define a custome deployment directory:
    $ EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh - Djboss.server.deploy.dir=/some_path/deployed_content

To validate:
    Visit PUBLICIP:8080/<appname> to ensure the application is working.
